/*
- pthread_create(thread_ptr, attr, routine, arg)
* Spawns a new thread that immediately runs the 'routine' function.
* Connection: Used to birth a philosopher who runs their lifecycle loop.

- pthread_join(thread, retval_ptr)
* Blocks the current thread until the specific 'thread' finishes.
* Connection: Main thread uses this to wait for all philosophers before exiting.

- pthread_detach(thread)
* Tells OS to reclaim thread resources automatically on finish; prevents joining.
* Connection: sometimes used for the death-monitoring thread to run independently.


- pthread_mutex_init(mutex_ptr, attr)
* Initializes a mutex object so it can be locked/unlocked.
* Connection: Turns a variable into a usable 'fork' before simulation starts.

- pthread_mutex_lock(mutex_ptr)
* Tries to take the lock; if taken, the thread waits/blocks until available.
* Connection: A philosopher taking a fork or protecting the print function.

- pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex_ptr)
* Releases the lock so other waiting threads can acquire it.
* Connection: A philosopher putting down a fork after eating.

- pthread_mutex_destroy(mutex_ptr)
* Invalidates the mutex and frees its resources (must be unlocked).
* Connection: Cleaning up forks/locks at the very end to prevent leaks.
