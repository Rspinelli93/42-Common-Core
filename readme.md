# 🧠 42 Common Core

Welcome to my **42 Common Core** repository!
This is a collection of the projects I completed during the 42 curriculum — documenting my progress from learning the C language to exploring system programming, networking, and algorithms.

## 📚 Overview

The **Common Core** is the heart of the 42 curriculum.
It focuses on building strong foundations in programming, problem-solving, and computer science through hands-on projects.

Topics covered include:

- 🖥️ C programming & memory management
- 🧵 UNIX system programming
- 📊 Algorithms & data structures
- 🔌 Networking fundamentals
- 🧱 Object-oriented programming basics (C++)
